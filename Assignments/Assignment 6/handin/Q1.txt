a) One of them utilizes the stack (in register 5) while the other just saves only the address in r6 and jumps to it
b) A benefit for using the stack would be if there are nested function calls.  If there are more than one call to a function,
we need to save more than one return address therefore we need to use the stack
c) The "reg" approach is simple, reading the assembly code would be more intuitive if we wanted to convert it back to 
simple C language.  Although this approach is very situational, it can only be used for one function call.
